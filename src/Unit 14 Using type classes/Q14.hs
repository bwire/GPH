-- Q14.1 Note that Enum doesnâ€™t require either Ord or Eq,

-- Q14.2 Define a five-sided die (FiveSidedDie type). 
-- Then define a type class named Die and at least one method that would be useful to have for a die. 
-- Also include superclasses you think make sense for a die. Finally, make your FiveSidedDie an instance of Die.
